# Welcome!
This is a memory game running on the NYTimes [kyt](https://github.com/NYTimes/kyt) framework. It's available to play [here](http://katieishibashi.nyc/memory-game/index.html). You have the option of playing with dog, cat, or pie cards. Enjoy!

## Setup

To help you get started†, we’ve created this starter project based on
[NYT kyt](https://github.com/NYTimes/kyt) that uses Webpack, Node, Babel,
Express, React and Sass + CSS Modules, all of which are technologies we use
internally. Feel free to extend the `package.json` with any other packages that
you might want to extend the app’s functionality (for data fetching, state
handling, etc.).

Clone this repository and run `npm install`, then `npm run dev` in the root
directory to start up the development server. Once it’s running, you can view
the app at `localhost:3000`††.
